        <p>
          A JavaScript library is a library of pre-written JavaScript code that
          allows for easier development of JavaScript-based applications,
          especially for AJAX and other web-centric technologies.

            With the expanded demands for JavaScript, an easier means for
            programmers to develop such dynamic interfaces was needed. Thus,
            JavaScript libraries and JavaScript widget libraries were developed,
            allowing for developers to concentrate more upon more distinctive
            applications of Ajax. This has led to other companies and groups,
            such as Microsoft and Yahoo! developing their own JavaScript-based
            user interface libraries, which find their way into the web
            applications developed by these companies.

            JavaScript libraries allow for easier integration of JavaScript with
            other web development technologies, such as CSS, PHP, Ruby, and
            Java. Many libraries include code to detect differences between
            runtime environments and remove the need for applications to allow
            for such inconsistencies.Almost all JavaScript libraries are
            released under either a copycenter or copyleft license to ensure
            license-free distribution, usage, and modification.

          <p>
            Some JavaScript libraries, such as Angular, are classified as
            frameworks since they exhibit full-stack capabilities and properties
            not found in general JavaScript libraries.
